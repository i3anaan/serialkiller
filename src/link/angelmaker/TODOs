ANGEL_MAKER TODOs

General:
>Check if improvements can be made somewhere in process.
>Check existing TODOs
>Buffer overflow management (drop/block?)		#>High Priority<#
>Thread safety, some specifics:
	>Diagram drawing (getCurrentReceivingNode(),getCurrentSendingNode())
	>Check thread safety in classes with 2 threads
		>ConstantRetransmittingManager probably has problems with this		#>High Priority<#
>Cleanup
	>Check logging (some unnecessary right now, some useful logs could be added)
	>Clean up tests (and possibly make new tests)
	>Better program structure
		>Clean up and improve interfaces
		>Make abstract base classes
>Documentation


AngelMaker:
>Constructor (Compatible with Starter?)
>Link with NetworkLayer			#>High Priority<#
>Some better testing of the entire system.
	>Error handling
	>Filler handling
	>Duplex sending
>Bit rate test (for cable)		#>High Priority<#


BitExchanger:
Mostly some experiments to improve overall speed.
>Try different techniques:
	>High Speed bit transfer		#>High Priority<#
	>No-inverse bit transfer
	>Half duplex (might reduce error rates)
>Try adding bit on timeout, might get bits received closer to bits send (ie, less missing bits).
>Experiment with timeouts (in specific READ_TIMEOUT_NO_ACK)
>Experiment with checkStable()
	>Maybe take average instead of X in a row.
	>Determine optimal amount in a row needed.


Nodes:
Mostly optimization, the Nodes already work.
>Less instances of everything, in specific:
	>Less cloning of BitSet2
	>Let a single Node do everything (less oversight, but more efficient).
	>Make Nodes reusable (Remove need to make new ones)

Flags:
Reduce overhead.
>Improve general algorithm
>Make specific flags (can probably be more efficient than general)
>Calculate optimal flag length.
>Add EndFlag test (No bit configuration in front of flag should ever form the end flag earlier)

Codec:
Stronger error detection.
>Explore possibilities for more efficient error detection
	>Should still allow 1-8 bytes.
>Explore effectiveness of using error correction.
	>Should also allow 1-8 bytes.
	>Should probably be able to deal with missing bits.
	
AMManager:
Retransmitting needs to be fixed, small improvements probably possible.
>Fix retransmits		#>High Priority<#		#>High Priority<#		#>High Priority<#		#>High Priority<#
	>Find out what goes wrong
		>Fix it
>Unit tests methods.
>Make it a Node (and AMManager), so that diagram drawing draws entire memory.
